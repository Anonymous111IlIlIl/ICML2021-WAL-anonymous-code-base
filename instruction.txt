The code base for weak annotation learning (ICML 2021 under review).

It is based on Pytorch version == 1.4.0 (Python 3.8.2)


First create a model_vis, model_vis_backup, log folder in the dictionary of with_DA and without_DA.

train_annotator_vis.py is for preparing the weak annotator
use command "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train_annotator_vis.py"

After running it, move the weak annotator you want from folder 'model_vis_backup' to 'model_vis' and rename it 'model.pth'.

train_vis.py is for training the model
use command "CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train_vis.py"

Current batchsize settings are for GPU memory >=20G, if you have smaller memory, you may need to change the batchsize settings or it may out of memory sometimes. And currently we do not support running on multi-GPU setting.
